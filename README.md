# Little-Lemon

This project was the capstone for the Meta Front-End Development Certification. Little Lemon is a web app built with React that allows users to reserve a table at the italian restuarant Little Lemon! Users can choose a custom date, an occasion, the size of their party, and a time for the reservation. I hope to expand more on this project in the future.
